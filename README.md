## Open Source Mentoring Web Application

Mentoria stands as a revolutionary platform, seamlessly connecting seasoned professional mentors with enthusiastic learners on a unified platform. At its core, this initiative is driven by a resolute commitment to counter the prevalent issues within corporate-driven courses, where the exploitation of novice learners occurs through the engagement of inexperienced instructors and the dissemination of misguided learning paths. In stark contrast, Mentoria champions an open-source ethos, diligently eliminating intermediaries (corporations) and forging a direct conduit between mentors and students.

Distinguished from traditional educational paradigms, Mentoria establishes an innovative space that nurtures self-directed learning, guided by the meticulously crafted roadmaps provided by mentors. This paradigm shift not only empowers learners to chart their own educational journey but also fosters an environment where expertise and knowledge exchange thrive organically, unencumbered by the constraints of conventional educational structures.
